/**
 * Makes Vivecraft VR melee work while standing on a Sable sub-level (train carriage), and — as a
 * side effect — stops the render-thread log-spam that the broken query produces.
 *
 * <p><b>The bug.</b> Vivecraft's {@code SwingTracker.activeProcess} broad-phases melee candidates
 * with {@code mc.level.getEntities(mc.player, swingAABB)}. When the player rides a Sable sub-level,
 * the swing AABB is built from a mix of the player's real (render) position and the player entity's
 * stored (sub-level logical, ~2.048e7) position, so it spans ~20 million blocks. Sable's
 * {@code SubLevelInclusiveLevelEntityGetter} rejects any query with
 * {@code AABB.getSize() > 100000}: it logs an ERROR with a captured stack trace and returns
 * <em>nothing</em>. Result: the VR swing finds no targets (melee silently fails on the train) and the
 * per-call stack-trace capture hitches the render thread.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The fix.</b> This wrap detects the pathologically-large swing AABB and rebuilds it as a small
 * box centred on the player's own bounding box, inflated to VR melee reach. That box is in the
 * player's current coordinate frame (the same frame as the on-carriage mobs at tick time), so Sable's
 * getter resolves it against the sub-level and returns the nearby mobs as candidates instead of
 * aborting. Vivecraft's own per-entity swing test then runs unchanged on those candidates, so hit
 * precision is preserved — we only repair the broad-phase box.</p>
 *
 * <p>An absurdly large AABB is the unambiguous signature of the sub-level coordinate mismatch: a real
 * VR swing box is only a few blocks across, so {@link SwingAabbClamp#MAX_SANE_SWING_SIZE} is far above
 * any legitimate query yet far below the mismatch. Using that as the trigger keeps the wrap a zero-cost
 * pass-through in every normal (non-train / non-VR) case and avoids per-tick sub-level lookups on the
 * render thread.</p>
 *
 * <p>The class is targeted by string because Vivecraft is not a compile dependency; this mod
 * declares Vivecraft a required dependency, so no presence check is needed. Verified with
 * {@code javap} against {@code vivecraft-1.21.1-1.3.15-neoforge.jar}. Scope is deliberately
 * narrow: VR melee on a sub-level only — no locomotion, ray-casts, GUI or seated play.</p>
 *
 * <p>Migrated from dungeon-train-mc, where it originally shipped. It was never Dungeon Train
 * specific — it is a generic Vivecraft × Sable bug — so it lives here now, alongside
 * {@link TeleportTrackerSubLevelMixin}, which fixes the same coordinate mismatch on the VR
 * teleport path. <b>DT must not also apply it</b>, or both copies would wrap the same call.</p>
