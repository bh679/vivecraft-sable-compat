/**
 * Pure decision logic for {@link games.brennan.vivecraftsable.mixin.SwingTrackerSubLevelAabbMixin}, kept OUT of the mixin package so it is a
 * normal class (Mixin's transformer claims everything under the mixin package) and unit-testable off the
 * render thread — no running game / no Vivecraft needed: a plain {@code AABB -> AABB} transform.
 *
 * <p>When a Vivecraft VR player stands on a Sable sub-level (e.g. a train carriage), the swing tracker's
 * {@code getEntities} AABB spans the player's real position to the sub-level pivot (~20 million blocks).
 * Sable's {@code SubLevelInclusiveLevelEntityGetter} aborts any query with {@code AABB.getSize() > 100000}
 * (and log-spams a stack trace). An absurdly large box is the unambiguous signature of that coordinate
 * mismatch — a real swing box is only a few blocks — so we treat any query above {@link #MAX_SANE_SWING_SIZE}
 * as broken and rebuild it as a small box centred on the player's own bounding box, inflated to VR melee
 * reach. That box is in the player's current frame (the same frame as the on-carriage mobs at tick time),
 * so Sable resolves it against the sub-level and returns the nearby mobs instead of aborting.</p>
